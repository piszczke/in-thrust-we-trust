Small python game based on one that I remember but can not find


Creating a 2D game similar to the one you described (with spaceships, destructible terrain, fuel, and ammunition management) using Python can be done with the help of the Pygame library. Below is a basic structure to get you started. This example will include:

Two spaceships that can be controlled by players.
A destructible terrain.
Basic mechanics for fuel consumption and ammunition usage.
Prerequisites
First, make sure you have Pygame installed. You can install it using pip:

```bash
pip install pygame
```
